# Shopping-Cart-React-Native

Hi,

This is a simple Shopping Cart application for ios or android, in which we can add products to the cart, increase or decrease the quantity of items, or remove products from the cart. It also shows the total amount of our cart. I have used different technologies such as react-native, redux, and expo. 

List of prerequisites: npm, expo-cli, ios or android simulator/expo app, and any editor.

To start a project, install packages: 
```
npm install
```
To run a project,
```
expo start
```

By the above commands, we can start our app. Please let me know if you find any errors in this project.

Thank you.
